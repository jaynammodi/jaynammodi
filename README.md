<img width="100px" align=right src="http://pywrite.herokuapp.com/static/media/logo.2b878ac4.svg"/>

 - 🌎: https://pywrite.herokuapp.com
 - Built and Commercialized a Python based assignments rendering program with a ReactJS Frontend allowing users to upload a word document with the contents of the assignment and choose their desired style settings to get a pixel-perfect, fully formatted handwritten PDF with Images, Tables, and Indentation imitating a handwritten document.

### Project Aletheia
 - 🌎: https://github.com/jaynammodi/ProjectAletheia
 - Developed a 16-bit Spectrally Normalized Generative Adversarial Network for Recosntruction of row and column droupouts in Short Wave Infrared Images captured by Satellites. The project was mentored and evaluated by ISRO in the final round of Smart India Hackathon 2020. Peak accuracy with an unrealisatically imbalanced input dataset was found to be 99.97% compared to the ground truth via Structural Similarity Index Metric. 

### Penetration Testing Tools for Android NDK
 - 🌎: https://github.com/jaynammodi | https://github.com/VoldemortCommunity
 - Developed one-of-a-kind penetration testing tools targeted to run on portable android devices and ported existing tools to be compatible with the same.

Here's what they don’t tell you:

Icarus laughed as he fell.
Threw his head back and
yelled into the winds,
arms spread wide,
teeth bared to the world.

There is a bitter triumph
in crashing when you should be
soaring.

The wax scorched his skin,
ran blazing trails down his back,
his thighs, his ankles, his feet.
Feathers floated like prayers
past his fingers,
close enough to snatch back.
Death breathed burning kisses
against his shoulders,
where the wings joined the harness.
The sun painted everything
in shades of gold.

There is a certain beauty
in setting the world on fire
and watching from the centre
of the flames.
